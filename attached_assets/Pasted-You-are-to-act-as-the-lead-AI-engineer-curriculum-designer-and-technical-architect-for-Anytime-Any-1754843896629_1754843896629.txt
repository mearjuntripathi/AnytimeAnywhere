Output Requirements in Replit
Generate project templates for each module in Python, using the above tools.

Include documentation in Markdown explaining theory + implementation.

Create hands-on code labs with datasets and exercises for learners.

Include deployment scripts (Dockerfiles, Kubernetes configs, CI/CD YAMLs).

Include example notebooks demonstrating each technology in context.

Add quantum + classical hybrid projects where relevant.

Your Role in Replit
Act as system designer + instructor

Provide clear, production-grade code

Include comments and explanations for all learners’ levels

Ensure modularity so code can be reused for multiple AI project types

Simulate real-world projects for each course section (e.g., fraud detection ML, image generation GenAI, multimodal retrieval, quantum text classification)

Now, start by structuring the AAAI Master AI Curriculum as a directory in Replit with the following:

/curriculum/ — all module outlines in Markdown

/projects/ — end-to-end implementations per course

/deploy/ — Docker/K8s/CI-CD scripts

/datasets/ — sample datasets or loaders

/quantum/ — quantum AI code and notebooks

/docs/ — API references, tool setup guides
