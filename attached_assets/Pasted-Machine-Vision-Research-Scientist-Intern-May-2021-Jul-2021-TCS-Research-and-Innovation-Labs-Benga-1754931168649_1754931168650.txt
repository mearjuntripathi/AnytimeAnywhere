SELECTED PROJECTS AND PUBLICATIONS
• Accelerated Implicit Neural Representations: Engineered an advanced encoder-decoder multiscale
block partitioning network architecture to represent N-dimensional signals via implicit neural representations. Achieved significant improvements in training and inference speeds, surpassing state-of-the-art
models by 25% in computational efficiency. This research tackles complex signal representation challenges,
optimising memory usage and scalability for high-dimensional data. [Pre-print]
• Semantic-Enhanced Image Captioning System with Siamese-GCN: Designed an innovative image
captioning system using Siamese Graph Convolutional Networks (S-GCN) integrated with a nonparametric Kernel Activation Function (KAF) and an LSTM-attention mechanism. The system enhanced semantic understanding of image data, enabling more accurate and context-aware captions. The
work was recognised and published at the 9th ACM IKDD CODS and 27th COMAD Conference,
contributing new insights into the field of image-to-text transformation. [Publication]
• Neural Language Model for Reverse Dictionary: Developed a novel neural language model to
predict target words based on informal descriptions using a combination of CBOW model, attention
word embedding, and a POS tagging channel. The model efficiently captured sub-word information,
yielding more accurate predictions. This work was presented at the 8th ACM IKDD CODS and 26th
COMAD Conference, showcasing advancements in natural language understanding and word prediction
mechanisms. [Publication]
